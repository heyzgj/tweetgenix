##App Flow Document##
When a user first arrives at the TweetGenix web application, they land on a simple and inviting page. The landing page greets them with a bold headline: "Generate Engaging Tweets with AI!" Just below, a short description explains what the app does: "Input your idea and a reference Twitter account, and let our AI craft a tweet that sounds just like you." A bright "Get Started" button catches their eye, encouraging them to dive in.
Clicking "Get Started" brings the user to the main generation page. This page keeps things clear and easy. At the top, there’s a text box labeled "Your tweet idea," where the user can type something like "Share a startup tip." Right below that, another text box asks for a "Reference Twitter tweet," with a placeholder like "@elonmusk
" to show what’s expected. Next to these, a dropdown lets the user pick how long they want their tweet to be: short, medium, or long.
After filling in their idea, reference tweet, and choosing a length, the user hits the "Generate" button. A little spinning loader appears, letting them know the app is working. Behind the scenes, the app studies reference tweet style. Then, it sends the user’s idea, the tweet length, and those reference tweets to the Gemini 2.0 Flash AI model to create a new tweet.
A few seconds later, the generated tweet shows up in a text box below the inputs. The user can read it and tweak it right there if they want to change anything. Underneath the text box, two buttons appear: "Save" and "Copy." Clicking "Copy" puts the tweet on their clipboard, and a quick "Copied!" message pops up. They can then head to Twitter and paste it themselves.
If the user clicks "Save," the tweet gets stored in their history. To check out their saved tweets, they can click a "History" link in the navigation bar at the top of the page. This takes them to a history page where all their saved tweets are listed, showing each tweet’s text and the date it was made. Beside every tweet, there’s a "Copy" button so they can grab it again whenever they want.
That’s the whole trip: landing on the page, generating a tweet, editing it, saving it, and looking back at past tweets—all designed to feel smooth and simple.
